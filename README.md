# Brain Tumor Detection with Grad-CAM

A deep learning web application built with Flask for detecting brain tumors in medical images. This project uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) fine-tuned for binary classification (tumor vs. no tumor). The model leverages transfer learning with pre-trained ImageNet weights for feature extraction.
The app includes Grad-CAM visualizations to highlight the areas of the image that most influenced the modelâ€™s decision, offering increased interpretability for clinical insight.
Includes image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) for consistent model performance. Users can upload their own medical images via a simple web interface and receive both the prediction and a visual explanation.
